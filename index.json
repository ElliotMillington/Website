The most developed of these is a network trained to distinguish whether noisy gabor patches were vertical or horizontal, pictured below. This is a replication of a paper by Bertone, Mottron, Jelenic, \u0026amp; Faubert (2005) which found that autistic people were better than typically developing people at some versions of their task.\nI then injected internal noise into the model when testing on a test set of data. By comparing the effects of different levels of internal and external noise, I demonstrated a proof-of-concept that different levels of noise will have effects on performance that are not necessarily intuitive.\nMy most recent project using neural networks involves using the Tensor Flow framework to make inferences about drawing styles using the Quick, Draw! dataset.\nReferences\nBertone, A., Mottron, L., Jelenic, P., \u0026amp; Faubert, J.

Is it a spectrum with everyone on it, or are autistic people their unique group? As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, all participant recruitment was suspended. As such, I reached out to all researchers who had ever used the Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire. These researchers gave me access to data from tens of thousands of participants from countries all of the world.\nHandling this amount of data from diverse sources came with challenges, however, I performed our intended analyses.
