Beginning from the leadership election of the Labour Party in 2016, this project has developed to take a broader vision of the political geography of the UK. This involves the publishing of our own work on our [website](https://psephography.wordpress.com/blog/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CLPNominations) accounts, as well as working with the data journalism teams of mainstream media outlets including the BBC, Financial Times, and New Statesman.

The most popular productions are still the crowd-sourced reporting of internal Labour Party elections, and the subsequent maps showing the results. Some examples of the content produced are below.
