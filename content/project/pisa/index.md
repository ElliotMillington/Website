The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a long running study by the OECD looking at the educational performance of 15-year-olds across the world. With funding from the Erasmus+ Programme, I developed an app analysing the data from the 600,000 students who took part in the 2018 tests. This app fulfils a dual purpose of being a learning aid for complex statistics as well as being a well-founded analysis of how Governments can affect educational outcomes. While the app continues to develop, an early version is currently being hosted [here](https://r.qhelp.eu/Glasgow/FormalModels/).
