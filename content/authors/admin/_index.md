bio: I am a postgraduate research student at the University of Glasgow where I am completing a PhD that's funded by the ESRC/SGSSS and supervised by Dr David Simmons and Dr Neil McDonnell. My research interests centre around autism, specificially how the senses and anxiety interact with each other. I am also interested in psychometrics and using Virtual Reality in research.

I am a postgraduate research student at the University of Glasgow where I am completing a PhD that's funded by the ESRC/SGSSS and supervised by Dr David Simmons and Dr Neil McDonnell. As part of my work, I am hoping to use virtual reality to raise and lower anxiety to test its effect on sensory processing.

I am also interested in researching how longer-term anxiety is behaviourally expressed in autism, especially the use of video games as a coping mechanism. My other research interests are related to psychometrics, specifically including modelling the underlying structures of autism and effectively understanding the experiences of children.
